	  This driver provides integrated hardware support for the Chuwi Minibook X
	  convertible laptop, including:
	  
	  - Automatic I2C accelerometer device instantiation with proper mount matrices
	  - Tablet mode detection using dual accelerometers (base and lid)
	  - Screen orientation detection and reporting
	  - Linux input subsystem integration for desktop environments
	  - Comprehensive sysfs interface for configuration and monitoring
	  
	  The driver automatically detects and instantiates MXC4005 accelerometer
	  devices on the appropriate I2C buses with correct mount matrix transformations
	  for proper orientation handling. It provides tablet mode switching events
	  compatible with desktop environments like GNOME and KDE.
	  
	  Features include:
	  - Hardware-based DMI detection for supported devices
	  - Event-driven tablet mode detection with configurable thresholds
	  - Mount matrix support for correct accelerometer orientation
	  - Sysfs interface for runtime configuration and data input
	  - Module parameters for hardware configuration

	  The driver will need the supporting userspace daemon from:
	    https://github.com/greymouser/minibook-x-tools
	  
	  Say Y or M here if you have a Chuwi Minibook X and want integrated
	  hardware support with tablet mode detection.

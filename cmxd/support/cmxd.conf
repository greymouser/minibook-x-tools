# Configuration for cmxd (Chuwi Minibook X Daemon - New Generation)
# This file is sourced by the daemon to set configuration values

# Device assignments are now automatically detected from the kernel module
# No manual device configuration is needed - the kernel module determines
# which IIO devices correspond to base and lid accelerometers

# Buffer read timeout in milliseconds (for event-driven sampling)
# This is NOT a polling interval - the daemon uses IIO triggers for event-driven sampling
# This timeout is used for the poll() system call that waits for buffer data
# Default: 100
# Range: 1-10000 (higher values = less CPU when idle, lower responsiveness on trigger failure)
BUFFER_TIMEOUT_MS=100

# Kernel module sysfs path (advanced users only)
# Default: /sys/devices/platform/cmx
# Uncomment only if you're using a custom kernel module path
#SYSFS_DIR=/sys/devices/platform/cmx

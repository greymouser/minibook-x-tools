# Logic Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The original script had **inverted logic** for determining sensor axis directions. The directional instructions were correct, but the mathematical analysis was backwards.

## The Problem
**Original (incorrect) logic:**
```bash
if [ $right_x_change -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "X+ points toward RIGHT side"
```

This said: "If X becomes more positive when right side is tilted up, then X+ points right."

## The Physics
When you tilt the **right side up**:
- Gravity shifts toward the **left side**
- If X+ points right, the sensor reads **more negative** (gravity pulling toward negative X)
- If X+ points left, the sensor reads **more positive** (gravity pulling toward positive X)

## The Fix
**Corrected logic:**
```bash
if [ $right_x_change -lt 0 ]; then
    echo "X+ points toward RIGHT side"
```

This says: "If X becomes more negative when right side is tilted up, then X+ points right."

## Verification
- **Right side up** → gravity toward left → X negative → X+ points right ✓
- **Left side up** → gravity toward right → X positive → X+ points right ✓
- **Front edge up** → gravity toward back → Y positive → Y+ points back ✓  
- **Back edge up** → gravity toward front → Y negative → Y+ points back ✓

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. The directional instructions match the mathematical analysis
2. Users get correct sensor orientation results
3. The script properly identifies how the base sensor is mounted
4. Driver development can proceed with accurate coordinate system mapping

The user instructions ("right side is where your right hand rests") were always correct - the issue was purely in the mathematical interpretation of the sensor response.

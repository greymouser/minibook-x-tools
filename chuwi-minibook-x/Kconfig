	select INPUT_POLLDEV
	help
	  This driver provides tablet mode detection and screen orientation
	  support for the Chuwi Minibook X convertible laptop.
	  
	  The driver uses dual accelerometers (base and lid) to detect when
	  the device is folded into tablet mode and to provide automatic
	  screen rotation based on device orientation.
	  
	  Features include:
	  - Automatic tablet mode detection with configurable thresholds
	  - 4-way screen orientation detection (normal/left/inverted/right)
	  - Linux input subsystem integration for desktop environments
	  - Comprehensive sysfs interface for configuration and monitoring
	  - Auto-calibration of hinge axis from accelerometer data
	  
	  Say Y or M here if you have a Chuwi Minibook X and want tablet
	  mode and orientation detection support.

config CHUWI_MINIBOOK_X_DEBUGFS
	bool "Chuwi Minibook X debugging support"
	depends on CHUWI_MINIBOOK_X && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Enable debugfs interface for detailed inspection of accelerometer
	  data, angle calculations, and internal module state. This is useful
	  for development and troubleshooting tablet mode detection issues.
	  
	  The debugfs interface provides:
	  - Raw accelerometer vector data and magnitudes
	  - Detailed angle calculation breakdowns
	  - Orientation detection statistics and confidence levels
	  - Hinge axis calibration information
	  
	  Say Y here if you need detailed debugging information for the
	  Chuwi Minibook X driver.

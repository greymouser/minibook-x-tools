# Directional Clarity Improvements

## Changes Made

I've updated all the diagnostic scripts to provide crystal-clear directional references, eliminating any ambiguity about which side is which.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Clear Reference System Added**
All scripts now start with this reference:
```
=== LAPTOP ORIENTATION REFERENCE ===
When sitting at the laptop in normal typing position:
• RIGHT = Where your RIGHT HAND naturally rests
• LEFT  = Where your LEFT HAND naturally rests
• FRONT = Edge closest to you (where palms/wrists rest)
• BACK  = Hinge side (where screen connects, farthest from you)
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Step Instructions**

**Base Axis Test (`base_axis_test.sh`):**
- **Right side up**: "When facing the laptop in normal laptop mode, your RIGHT HAND rests on the RIGHT SIDE"
- **Left side up**: "When facing the laptop in normal laptop mode, your LEFT HAND rests on the LEFT SIDE"
- **Front edge up**: "REFERENCE: When facing the laptop in normal laptop mode, the FRONT EDGE is where your palms/wrists rest"
- **Back edge up**: "REFERENCE: When facing the laptop in normal laptop mode, the BACK EDGE is where the hinge/screen connects"

**Lid/Base Test (`sensor_test.sh`):**
- **Lid tilt**: "REFERENCE: Tilt the screen portion away from you, toward the back (as if opening the laptop wider than normal)"

#### 3. **Consistent Language Throughout**

**Status Script (`sensor_status.sh`):**
- "tilted right (toward right hand)" instead of just "tilted right"
- "tilted left (toward left hand)" instead of just "tilted left"
- "tilted away from user (back/hinge down)" instead of "tilted away/back"
- "tilted toward user (front edge down)" instead of "tilted toward/forward"

#### 4. **Analysis Output Improvements**

**Base Axis Test Analysis:**
- "X-axis points toward the RIGHT SIDE of laptop (where right hand rests)"
- "Y-axis points toward the FRONT of laptop (where palms rest)"
- "Standard laptop coordinate system: X+ = Right side (where right hand rests)"

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Confusion**: No more wondering "which right?" or "from whose perspective?"
2. **Consistent References**: All scripts use the same reference system
3. **Physical Anchors**: References actual hand positions and physical features users can feel
4. **Clear Context**: Always establishes the "normal typing position" as the reference point

## User Experience

Now when users run any diagnostic script, they'll get clear, unambiguous instructions like:
- "Rotate so the side where your RIGHT HAND rests is pointing up"
- "Tilt toward the edge where your palms rest while typing"
- "The hinge side (back edge) should point toward the ceiling"

This ensures accurate test results and eliminates the primary source of confusion in orientation testing.

Final comprehensive analysis of I2C devices and UU status.

COMPLETE DEVICE MAPPING:
- i2c-11:0x15 → MXC4005 Accelerometer (base sensor) - bound by our driver
- i2c-12:0x15 → MXC4005 Accelerometer (lid sensor) - bound by our driver  
- i2c-13:0x5D → Goodix Touchscreen Controller - bound by Goodix-TS driver (UU)
- i2c-14:0x?? → XXXX0000 (PNP0C50) Touchpad - bound by i2c_hid_acpi driver
- i2c-14:0x33 → Unknown device - unbound
